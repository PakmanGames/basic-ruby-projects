# Collection of Small Ruby Projects
The purpose of this repo is to just practice Ruby and get used to the syntax as well as various methods to use at my disposal.

To run any of these projects it requires ruby to be installed. To run, make sure you are in the correct directory then in the terminal type `ruby ./main.rb`. The code can also be run from within a [Replit Environment](https://replit.com/languages/ruby) if you prefer to do so.  
All the projects include test cases in `testcases.txt` to provide example inputs and their expected outputs.
