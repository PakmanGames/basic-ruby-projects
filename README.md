# Ruby Caesar Cipher
This is my first mini project in ruby.  
I was able to apply my newly learned skills to write methods in ruby, use various string, integer, and array methods to manipulate data.

To run the project clone it then type `ruby ./main.rb` into the terminal. (Requires Ruby to be installed). Or you can run the code in a [Replit environment](https://replit.com/languages/ruby)  
Test cases are included in the `testcases.txt` file.

The method I wrote takes a string and a key representing the shift to encrypt the message using a [Caesar Cipher](https://cryptii.com/pipes/caesar-cipher).

### Explanation of the code:
The String and Integer classes each have the methods `#ord` and `#chr` respectively, the string method converts the character into an integer via [ascii encoding](https://www.ascii-code.com/) and the integer method converts the integer back into the corresponding character.
